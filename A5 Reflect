1. My Learning Journey

When the course started, I had a basic understanding of Python and a solid structural background, but connecting those two worlds was still unfamiliar. IFC felt large and abstract, and I didn’t really know how to approach it beyond simple element queries.

Over the weeks, this changed quite quickly. As we built our tool, I learned how to identify the important IFC relationships for structural elements — profile sets, materials, mapped items and typed definitions. More importantly, I learned how to make the script robust when the model doesn’t behave perfectly. 

By the time we finished A3, I felt comfortable moving around IFC files, extracting the geometry we needed, and connecting that to Eurocode rules. The biggest shift for me is that I now think of structural claims (like “minimum width 200 mm”) as something that can be checked automatically rather than something I verify once in a spreadsheet.

2. Shared Work: The Tool and the Tutorial

Our beam checking tool grew out of the claim from A2. We both contributed to the logic, and we ended up with a script that:

- reads all `IfcBeam` elements  
- extracts cross-section dimensions through several fallback strategies  
- converts units  
- runs EC2 width, bending and shear checks  
- exports a clean spreadsheet  

That process was the core of my learning. We had to understand the IFC structure well enough to pull out usable geometry, and then reason through how those values influence EC2 calculations.

Creating the tutorial in A4 helped solidify everything. Explaining the steps forced me to check that each part actually made sense to someone who did not write the code. The peer feedback confirmed that our logic was clear but also pointed out that we could have shown more examples of “messy” cases. That’s something I would include in a future version.

I see the tool’s natural place in **ABD Stage C (Verification & Analysis)**, with the spreadsheet output benefiting **Stage D (Documentation)** as part of evidence-based reporting.

3. What I Still Want to Learn

Even though I feel much more confident now, there are still areas I want to develop:

- handling advanced and irregular geometry  
- writing cleaner and more structured code  
- improving model validation before running checks  
- understanding how IFC connects to other design tools  

The course also gave me ideas for a future thesis. I can imagine exploring automated checking in more detail or combining IFC data with performance-based design.

If I could adjust something in the course, I might prefer slightly fewer tool introductions and more time spent on testing and refining the tools we build.

4. Future Use of OpenBIM

For my thesis, I am likely to use OpenBIM again — either for automated structural checking or for a workflow that mixes IFC with simulation.

In terms of career, I am almost certain that BIM-based verification will be part of structural engineering in the coming years. Automating EC2 checks from IFC models seems like something that will quickly shift from “nice to have” to “expected”.

5. Wrap-up of A1–A5

- A1 taught me to treat BIM as evidence rather than just geometry.  
- A2 helped us formulate a clear, testable structural claim.  
- A3 turned that claim into working code.  
- A4 made us explain that work to others.  
- A5 ties the full learning journey together.  

Overall, the course has given me a practical understanding of how OpenBIM can support structural engineering, not just in concept but through hands-on tools that actually check design assumptions.

1. My Learning Journey

At the start of the semester, I felt confident with Eurocode design and structural reasoning, but the digital side of things — especially IFC — felt unfamiliar. I could follow Python logic if I concentrated, but I didn’t really understand how information was structured in a BIM model.

Working through the assignments gradually changed this. As we built the tool together, I learned what information lives where inside an IFC file and how to extract it through relationships like `HasAssociations` and `IsTypedBy`. I also learned how unpredictable real models can be, and that a good checking script needs several ways of finding the same piece of information.

By the end of the course, I had a much clearer picture of how structural engineering data and OpenBIM can support each other. I wouldn’t call myself a programmer, but I now feel comfortable participating in a workflow where coding is part of the engineering process.

2. Shared Work: The Tool and the Tutorial

Our joint tool for A3 became the main reference point for my learning. The core idea was simple — check that beams meet Eurocode 2 requirements — but making it reliable took a lot of thinking. We had to combine several types of profile extraction, handle missing data, and make sure the calculations matched the code.

My contribution leaned more toward interpreting the Eurocode rules, documenting assumptions and making sure the outputs were meaningful to someone reading them as an engineer.

The A4 tutorial was also valuable because it forced us to turn a technical script into a story. The feedback we received was both encouraging and useful. People understood the purpose of the tool and appreciated the structure, but they also pointed out that including more examples of problematic beams would make the tutorial stronger.

I agree with that — it reflects what we experienced when writing the script. The tool belongs mainly in **ABD Stage C**, where design requirements are checked, but it naturally provides documentation for **Stage D** as well.

3. What I Still Want to Learn

There are several areas I want to improve moving forward:

- gaining confidence in modifying larger parts of the code  
- understanding how IFC connects to simulation tools  
- improving my ability to clean and interpret BIM data  
- working with more advanced representations, not just standard profiles  

The course also gave me a better sense of what a potential thesis might look like. I now see OpenBIM as a realistic foundation for structural topics, whether that is automated checking, data validation or performance-based design workflows.

On the course design: I liked the freedom, but I can also see how having slightly narrower use case options might make the early weeks easier for people who are less certain of their direction.

4. Future Use of OpenBIM

Whether my thesis ends up being directly BIM-related or not, I expect to use IFC as a data source again. The ability to tie model information to engineering checks is something I now see real value in.

Professionally, I am quite confident OpenBIM will shape the way we communicate and verify designs. Automating Eurocode-related checks feels like something the industry will rely on more and more, especially as models become the primary source of truth.

5. Wrap-up of A1–A5

- A1 introduced the idea of treating models as evidence.  
- A2 helped us define a clear and practical structural claim.  
- A3 was where the claim became a functioning tool.  
- A4 turned our technical work into something teachable.  
- A5 is where I look back and connect everything to my future learning path.  

Overall, my biggest takeaway is that OpenBIM is not separate from structural engineering — it can support and enhance it when used through tools like the one we built.
