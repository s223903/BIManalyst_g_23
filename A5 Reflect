## 1. My Learning Journey

When the course started, I had a basic understanding of Python and a solid structural background, but connecting those two worlds was still unfamiliar. IFC felt large and abstract, and I didn’t really know how to approach it beyond simple element queries.

Over the weeks, this changed quite quickly. As we built our tool, I learned how to identify the important IFC relationships for structural elements — profile sets, materials, mapped items and typed definitions. More importantly, I learned how to make the script robust when the model doesn’t behave perfectly. 

By the time we finished A3, I felt comfortable moving around IFC files, extracting the geometry we needed, and connecting that to Eurocode rules. The biggest shift for me is that I now think of structural claims (like “minimum width 200 mm”) as something that can be checked automatically rather than something I verify once in a spreadsheet.

## 2. Shared Work: The Tool and the Tutorial

Our beam checking tool grew out of the claim from A2. We both contributed to the logic, and we ended up with a script that:

- reads all `IfcBeam` elements  
- extracts cross-section dimensions through several fallback strategies  
- converts units  
- runs EC2 width, bending and shear checks  
- exports a clean spreadsheet  

That process was the core of my learning. We had to understand the IFC structure well enough to pull out usable geometry, and then reason through how those values influence EC2 calculations.

Creating the tutorial in A4 helped solidify everything. Explaining the steps forced me to check that each part actually made sense to someone who did not write the code. The peer feedback confirmed that our logic was clear but also pointed out that we could have shown more examples of “messy” cases. That’s something I would include in a future version.

I see the tool’s natural place in **ABD Stage C (Verification & Analysis)**, with the spreadsheet output benefiting **Stage D (Documentation)** as part of evidence-based reporting.

## 3. What I Still Want to Learn

Even though I feel much more confident now, there are still areas I want to develop:

- handling advanced and irregular geometry  
- writing cleaner and more structured code  
- improving model validation before running checks  
- understanding how IFC connects to other design tools  

The course also gave me ideas for a future thesis. I can imagine exploring automated checking in more detail or combining IFC data with performance-based design.

If I could adjust something in the course, I might prefer slightly fewer tool introductions and more time spent on testing and refining the tools we build.

## 4. Future Use of OpenBIM

For my thesis, I am likely to use OpenBIM again — either for automated structural checking or for a workflow that mixes IFC with simulation.

In terms of career, I am almost certain that BIM-based verification will be part of structural engineering in the coming years. Automating EC2 checks from IFC models seems like something that will quickly shift from “nice to have” to “expected”.

## 5. Wrap-up of A1–A5

- **A1** taught me to treat BIM as evidence rather than just geometry.  
- **A2** helped us formulate a clear, testable structural claim.  
- **A3** turned that claim into working code.  
- **A4** made us explain that work to others.  
- **A5** ties the full learning journey together.  

Overall, the course has given me a practical understanding of how OpenBIM can support structural engineering, not just in concept but through hands-on tools that actually check design assumptions.
